# What does this Merge Request do?

## Queries

### 1. Fetching Currency Rates

We first fetch the currency rates using `useGetCurrenciesRate`s, which makes an API call to retrieve the exchange rates for different currencies. These rates are cached by TanStack Query, avoiding unnecessary repeated requests.

### 2. Fetching and Transforming Transactions

Once the rates are available, `useGetTransactions` fetches the transaction data and applies a transformation to convert amounts using the fetched rates. The select option ensures the transformation happens before returning the data, and the enabled flag ensures transactions are only fetched after rates are loaded.

### Benefits of TanStack Query:

- Automatic Caching: Avoids refetching data that hasn't changed, improving performance and reducing redundant API calls.
- Background Fetching: Keeps data fresh by automatically refetching in the background when needed (e.g., when the component is re-mounted).
- Optimistic Updates: Supports optimistic UI updates for faster interactions.
- Declarative Data Fetching: Allows for easy integration of async logic, making code simpler and more maintainable.
- Error and Loading States: Automatically handles loading, error, and success states, reducing boilerplate code.

## Reasoning and Design Pattern

The `TransactionsList` component implements a generic table management system that displays a list of transactions, allowing for features like sorting and selection. The design pattern primarily used here is Container-Presenter.

- `Container`: The component handles the business logic of data fetching, state management (sorting, selection), and data transformation (sorting and preparing data for display).
- `Presenter`: The `DataTable` component acts as a presenter, responsible for rendering the table structure and passing user interactions (e.g., sorting, row selection) back to the container.

## Benefits of this Approach:

- Separation of Concerns: The business logic (sorting, selection) is separated from the presentation (table rendering), making the code easier to maintain and extend.
- Reusability: The DataTable component is designed generically, which can be reused for other data types by simply providing the appropriate columns and data.
- State Management: The Set for selected rows ensures an efficient and clean way to handle multiple selections without duplicates.
- Asynchronous Handling: By using isLoading and error, the component gracefully handles asynchronous data fetching, improving user experience.

# If I Had More Time

If I had more time, I would improve the implementation with the following enhancements:

## **1. Adding i18n for Texts**

Implementing **internationalization (i18n)** would make the application more scalable and accessible to users from different regions. Instead of hardcoding text strings, we could use a library like **react-i18next** to manage translations dynamically.

### **Benefits of i18n:**

- **Multi-language support**: Easily switch between different languages without modifying the code.
- **Better user experience**: Users can interact with the UI in their preferred language.
- **Separation of concerns**: Keeps text management separate from the code, making it easier to update translations.

## **2. Using Context for Selection State**

Currently, the selection state (`selectedTransactions`) is managed locally within the `TransactionsList` component. While this works fine, we could introduce **React Context** to manage selection state globally.

### **Why Consider Context?**

- It would allow multiple components to access and modify the selection state without prop drilling.
- Useful if multiple parts of the application need to interact with the selected items (e.g., a bulk action menu outside the table).

#### **Why Itâ€™s Not Necessarily Needed Here?**

- The selection logic is only relevant to `TransactionsList`, so adding Context might be **overkill** and introduce unnecessary complexity.
- Context updates can be expensive if not optimized, leading to unnecessary re-renders.

Instead, the current approach using local state (`useState`) is more efficient for this specific use case, as selection only affects this component and its child (`DataTable`).
